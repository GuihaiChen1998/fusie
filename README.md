# README

Graduation issues are handling...  More codes are coming...

## Update: 2023.2
Upload utils.

## Update: 2022.12
Due to graduation issues, development of the project's API is temporarily suspended.

## Update: 2022.9.1
Still, we are now working on making a complete API.

---
This repo is for our code about an example of our project/paper. 
> Note: Our framework has not been developed as a complete API, and changing submodels requires manual code changes, except for some components. Anyway, until a full API is developed, frequent code changes make it not easy to use at the moment. Here, we provide an simple example of InteractE-KGML-ConvKB which consists of InteractE (for EP), KGML (for RP), and ConvKB (for TC). 

## Useage
Following read.md.

And then we will get something like this:
