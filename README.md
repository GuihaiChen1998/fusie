# fusie
This repo is for our code about an example of the project “fusie”. 
> Note: Our framework has not been developed as a complete API, and changing submodels requires manual code changes, except for some components. Anyway, until a full API is developed, frequent code changes make it not easy to use at the moment. Here is an simple example of InteractE-KGML-ConvKB which consists of InteractE (for EP), KGML (for RP), and modified ConvKB (for TC). 

## Useage
Following read.md.
----

### Update: 2022.12
