# fusie
This repo is for our code about the project “fusie”. 
> Note: Here is not all of our codes. We only put out one of the structural codes of fusie, which includes InteractE (for EP), KGML (for RP), and ConvE (for TC). The full codes will be released after our paper "fusie" is accepted by the conference. Or we would like to open the source code after we have made fusie a complete API (we are now working on making a API about fusie).
